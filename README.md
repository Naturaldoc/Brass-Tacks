<h1>BG Foundation</h1>
<hr />
<p>
	<strong>BG Foundation</strong> is a Sass based, object oriented CSS / HTML5 framework that I've been building over the last few years.
</p>

<p>
	It is still quite in development, but many of the ideas here have been inspired by, or expanded on by such fine folks as:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Harry Roberts</li>
	<li>Nicole Sullivan</li>
	<li>And more to come...<li>
</ul>

<p>BG Foundation requires Sass 3.2</p>
