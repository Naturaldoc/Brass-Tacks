# Bleached readme rough draft v 0.2

<hr />

Bleached is a professional front-end HTML5 and SCSS framework that incorporates and standardizes many
widely used HTML and CSS elements.

Bleached was built quietly over many years of standardizing the way I write my code, and incorporating 
the best practices of other web designers and developers in the field.  

Many other developers have had a hand in helping me shape Bleached's outcome.  I will list them here and 
likely rewrite this into later.

A current(maybe?) build can be viewed at http://playground.scott-ohara.mixture.io/ (for now)

<hr />

<strong>Bleached</strong> is a Sass based, object oriented CSS / HTML5 framework that I've been building over the last few years.

Look to this area (or other readme files) for extended documentation and best practices.

This is still quite in development, but many of the ideas here have been inspired by, or expanded on by such fine folks as:

* Harry Roberts
* Nicole Sullivan
* And more to come...

## Bleached Specifics

* HTML5 ready building and general styling
* Modern Browser friendly with compatibility for IE7+

* Google Analytics placeholder
* HTML5shiv via CDN, with local fallback
* jQuery 1.10.1 ready via CDN, with a local fallback
* IE-Specific classes on the HTML element for easer cross-browser control.

* Various HTML ready-to-use snippets
* CSS helper classes

* Extensive inline and accompanying documentation




Credit to normalize.css's HTML example for providing a good base of HTML tags to test from, and to 
use as a list of tags to consider for this foundation and tags that are just not important in
the majority of website projects I've been involved with.
