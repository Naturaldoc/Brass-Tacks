<h1>BG Foundation</h1>
<hr />
A current(maybe?) build can be viewed at http://playground.scott-ohara.mixture.io/ (for now)

<p>
	<strong>BG Foundation</strong> is a Sass based, object oriented CSS / HTML5 framework that I've been building over the last few years.
</p>
<p>
	This framework should make for a solid base to any website/web app project, that can be extended upon easily.
</p>

<p>
	Look to this area (or other readme files) for extended documentation and best practices.
</p>

<p>
	It is still quite in development, but many of the ideas here have been inspired by, or expanded on by such fine folks as:
</p>

* Harry Roberts
* Nicole Sullivan
* And more to come...


<hr />

<p>BG Foundation requires Sass 3.2</p>

<p>
	Credit to normalize.css's HTML example for providing a good base of HTML tags to test from, and to 
	use as a list of tags to consider for this foundation and tags that are just not important in
	the majority of website projects I've been involved with.
